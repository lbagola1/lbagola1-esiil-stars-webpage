<h5> Senior at Oglala Lakota College;
  Conservation Biology major </h5>
  
  My Name is LaShell (Poor Bear)Bagola I am Oglala Lakota from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation located in South Dakota.
  I am currently a senior at Oglala Lakota College and will graduate next Spring 2024 with a BS in Natural Science with an emphasis in Conservation Biology.
  My goals include developing a traditional seed bank and preserving all native plants of the prairie and black hills, including traditional teachings/medicinal uses, and community gardens on my reservation.
  My hobbies include beading and sewing traditional regalia. I taught myself how to do both. I also enjoy reading books, taking care of my plants, hiking, camping, fishing, cooking, working out, gardening, painting/drawing, walking my dogs. Anything that means being active or being in nature.
  My passions include clean water, clean air, the land, animals, health, my family, and my culture.
  I have two pit bulls one named Princess and the other named Mr. Sppoky Tuxedo Burrito (a rescue from Denver Colorado), they are new parents to 3 little puppies, who my daughter absolutely adores.
  My partner and I are expecting our second daughter the end of May/early June. I take pride in and prioritize my family and culture above all else.
    

<h5> I am happy to be returning this summer to continue my skillset in coding, github, working as an active team member, and learning as well as mentoring. I'm excited to see what projects come about and how I can be involved. </h5>
